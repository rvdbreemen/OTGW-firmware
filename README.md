OpenTherm Nodoshop OTGW hardware - an ESP8266 firmware

This project is an firmware for the Nodoshop OTGW hardware, based on ESP8266 devkits.

Starting with version 2.3 of the Nodoshop hardware the devkit has changed from NodeMCU to a Wemos D1mini. This is fully supported by the hardware and this firmware.

Supporting hardware version are:
| Version | Hardware supported |
|-|-|
|1.x-2.0|NodoMCU ESP8266 devkit|
|2.3-2.x|Wemos D1mini ESP8266 devkit|

It can be found here: https://www.nodo-shop.nl/nl/opentherm-gateway/211-opentherm-gateway.html  
More information on this gateway can be read here: http://otgw.tclcode.com/  (also location of the OTGW PIC firmware) 

The goal of this project is to become a fully functioning ESP8266 based OTGW-firmware that operates the OTGW as a standalone application. Providing:
- a WebUI
- bidirection MQTT support
- a REST API
- automatic integration with Home Assistant (Home Assistant Core v2021.2.0+)
- and a TCP socket for serial connection

**Breaking change: With version 0.8.0 MQTT Discovery topic naming convention has changed significantly, this will break MQTT based applications.**
**Breaking change: With version 0.7.2 (and up) the LitteFS filesystem is used. This means you need to reflash your device using a usb cable, all settings are lost in the process.**


The features of this Nodosop OpenTherm Gateware ESP8266 based firmware are:
- configuration via the webUI on port 80: flash your ESP8266 and edit settings via the webUI
- userfriendly file handling using LittleFS (breaking change v0.7.2+)
- parsing the OT protocol on the ESP8266
- parsing all known OT protocol message ID's (OpenTherm v2.2+2.3b), including Heating/Ventilation and Remeha specific msgid's
- wide range of connection and data sharing options:
  - telnet (interpreted data and debugging)
  - MQTT (publishing every parsed OT message, publish commands to this topic `OTGW/set/<node id>/command`)
  - simple REST GET API (`http://<ip>/api/v0/otgw/{id}`)
  - simple REST GET API (`http://<ip>/api/v1/otgw/id/{id}` or `http://<ip>/api/v1/otgw/label/{textlabel eg. Tr or Toutside}`
  - simple REST PUT or POST commands on `/api/v1/otgw/command/{any command})`
  - serial interface on port 25238 for original OTmonitor application (bi-directional)
  - OTmonitor Web UI (standalone interface)
- automatic integration with Home Assistant using _Home Assistant Discovery_ (Home Assistant Core v2021.2.0+)
- integration with any MQTT based Home Automation solution, like Domoticz (plugin available) & OpenHAB
- reliable OTGW PIC upgrades (v0.6.0+), to the latest firmware available at http://otgw.tclcode.com/download.html
- cleaner RestAPI's for Telegraf OTmonitor integration
- readout Dallas-type temperture sensors (eg. DS18B20) connected to GPIO
 
**Warning: Never flash your OTGW PIC firmware through wifi using OTmonitor application, you can brick your OTGW PIC. Instead use the buildin PIC firmware upgrade feature (based on code by Schelte Bron)**

To do:
- InfluxDB client to do direct logging 
- Instant update of webUI using websockets
- Showing log of OT messages using websockets847
