To use the firmware with the original OTmonitor software (found here: https://otgw.tclcode.com/otmonitor.html)

To use the OTmonitor software with this firmware:
1. Download and install the OTmonitor app
2. Launch the application, and hit F5 (menu: Options --> Settings)
3. Click on the Connection in the left navigation (--> Connection)
![configuration otmonitor](https://github.com/rvdbreemen/OTGW-firmware/blob/main/docs/2021-01-12-OTmonitor_configuration.png)
4. Select the TCP connection, either enter **otgw.local** or the **IP number**
5. Enter remote port **25238** (before 0.7.1 it was 1023)
6. And click the [CONNECT] button

And if all works well, you will now see the OTmonitor software at work.

Also you can upgrade your PIC firmware on the OTGW hardware thru the OTmonitor application. Read more about that on the original OTGW website.
