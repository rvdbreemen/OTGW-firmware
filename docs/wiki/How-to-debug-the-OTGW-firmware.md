# Logging the firmware
To debug the firmware, just connect to port 23 using a Telnet client, like PuTTY (https://www.putty.org/).

To share a debug log, just store the logfile. Then add the logfile to a github issue to enable help with debugging your issue remotely.

If you cannot solve problems by yourself, or, found a bug, or can't get it to work. Just post an "issue" right here in github. Or come and join my Discord community.

# Checking MQTT using MQTT explorer
To make sure your MQTT is working correctly after you can use the MQTT Explorer client tool (http://mqtt-explorer.com/). After setting up MQTT explorer on your PC, you can logon to your MQTT hub. When you have MQTT configured using the WebUI, you should see data go through your MQTT broker.
