## ADR Compliance Checklist

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural choices.**  
See [docs/adr/README.md](../docs/adr/README.md) and [.github/skills/adr/](../.github/skills/adr/) for guidance.

- [ ] I have reviewed existing ADRs in `docs/adr/README.md`
- [ ] My changes do **not** violate any existing architectural decisions
- [ ] I have verified my changes against relevant ADRs:
  - [ ] ADR-003: HTTP-Only (no HTTPS/WSS)
  - [ ] ADR-004: Static Buffer Allocation (no String class in critical paths)
  - [ ] ADR-009: PROGMEM String Literals (F() and PSTR() macros used)
  - [ ] Other relevant ADRs: <!-- List ADR numbers -->
- [ ] If this introduces an **architectural change**, I have created a new ADR with Status: Proposed
- [ ] If implementing an existing ADR, I have updated its status (e.g., Proposed → Accepted)
- [ ] I have added code comments referencing relevant ADRs where appropriate
- [ ] If I created a new ADR, I have updated `docs/adr/README.md` index
